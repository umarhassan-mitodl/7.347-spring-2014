description: Induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) derived from skin cells. The regions
  shown in green are proteins found in iPSCs but not found in skin cells. The red
  dots show the inactivated X chromosome in each cell. These cells can develop into
  a variety of possible cell types. See Lecture Summary 3 for more information on
  iPSCs. (Image by Kathrin Plath lab, University of California, Los Angeles, via CIRM,
